# My MSc Thesis

My MSc was in Medical Imaging and Computer Vision at the Victoria University of Manchester (after merging with UMIST, it became The University of Manchester).

My MSc Thesis was on [Computer Vision and Analysis of the Carotid Artery](MSc%20Thesis%201999-10-06-22-27.pdf)

The current version here does have a few images missing as the submission was on paper and, in 1999, cutting and pasting with real scissors and glue was sometimes easier than the digital method.

Note: back then my surname was Pigram but, when we got married, my wife had the brilliant idea of merging surnames to create the new surname Barram.
